## TODO:

 + [x] Remove `eval` or `feval` in `main.m`
 + [x] Write results in `.xls` table or `MATLAB` table
 + [x] Read `ENVI` `*.img` file directly 
 + [ ] Pre-processing methods
 + [ ] Benchmark script
 + [ ] Extend `MAD` and `IRMAD` to handle more complex cases, e.g., inputs with inconsistent channels
 + [ ] Adaptively select `k` for algorithms such as `PCDA` according to the contribution rate
 + [x] Script to process a single image pair
 + [x] Folder (a Dataset) to process a folder
 + [ ] Graphic user interface
 + [ ] Image savers?
 + [ ] Add more CD algorithms
 + [ ] Implement the interface of more datasets
