## TODO:
 + [x] Remove `eval` or `feval` in `main.m`
 + [ ] Add more CD algorithms
 + [ ] Implement the interface of more datasets
 + [ ] Write results in `.xls` table or `MATLAB` table
 + [ ] New attribute of CDDataset to discriminate the type (e.g. SAR data or Satellite images)
 + [ ] Read `ENVI` `*.img` file directly 
 + [ ] Pre-processing methods
 + [ ] Benchmark script
 + [ ] Extend `MAD` and `IRMAD` to handle more complex cases, e.g., inputs with inconsistent channels
 + [ ] Replace the implicit expansions for compatibility with older versions
 + [ ] Adaptively select `k` for algorithms such as `PCDA` according to the contribution rate
